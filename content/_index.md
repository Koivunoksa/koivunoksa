## Table beneath the birches

Koivunoksa keeps its focus on a concise weekly menu so that every ingredient can be harvested, preserved, and plated at its peak. Lunch leans lighter, dinner stretches into five thoughtful waves, and a chef's counter is available for deeper tastings with advance booking. Reservations open 30 days ahead.
